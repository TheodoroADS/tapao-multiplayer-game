# Tap√£o! Multiplayer Game

# ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is a yet to be online multiplayer game. A singleplayer version of the game is already playable, but multiplayer is not implemented yet, and the game looks like crap for now. The reason for me already uploading it here is that I have spent enough hours on it already to want to save it somewhere, and I wanted to show this project to a friend and any kind stranger willing to give me some advice on how to continue üôÇ.    


# What the hell is a Tap√£o??

Have a read [here](http://jogosdecartas.hut.com.br/tapao/) (it is in portuguese but you can perhaps translate it with your browser). Sorry, I couldn't find a link in english.
